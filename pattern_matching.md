title: Pattern Matching & Regular Expressions
---

The [ANSI Common Lisp standard](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/index.html) does not include facilities for pattern matching and regular expressions, but a couple of libraries exist for this task. See the respective [Cliki page](http://www.cliki.net/Regular%20Expression) for details and links.

Note that some CL implementations include regexp facilities, notably [CLISP](http://clisp.sourceforge.net/impnotes.html#regexp) and [ALLEGRO CL](http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/6.1/doc/regexp.htm). If in doubt, check your manual or ask your vendor.
